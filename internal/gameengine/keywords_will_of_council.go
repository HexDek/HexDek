// keywords_will_of_council.go — Will of the Council (CR §701.18,
// Conspiracy 2014) two-option voting.
//
// Printed pattern:
//
//   "Will of the council — Starting with you, each player votes for
//    [option A] or [option B]. [Effect tied to whichever option got
//    more votes.]"
//
// CR §701.18a: When a Will of the Council ability instructs each player
//              to vote, voting proceeds in turn order starting with the
//              controller of the spell or ability. Each player votes
//              for one of the listed options.
// CR §701.18b: The card text specifies how ties are resolved (some
//              cards split the effect across both options, others say
//              "if the vote is tied, [option A] gets one more vote",
//              etc.). When the printed text is silent on ties, the
//              controller of the resolving spell/ability decides — but
//              by the Conspiracy 2014 / Commander Legends convention
//              the default for "split" wording is that NEITHER option
//              wins outright and the resolver picks how to apply both.
//
// This file provides the generic tally machinery — TallyWillOfCouncil
// returns the winner string ("" on a tie) and the per-option tally map
// so the resolver (the per_card handler implementing a specific WotC
// card) can branch on majority or apply tie-specific behavior.
//
// API shape:
//
//   winner, tally := TallyWillOfCouncil(
//       gs, controllerSeat,
//       "carnage", "homage",
//       func(seat int, options [2]string) int { /* ... */ },
//   )
//
// The callback receives the seat being polled and the two option
// strings (so seat-aware AI can reason about which option benefits
// whom); it returns 0 for optionA or 1 for optionB. Any other return
// is treated as an abstention (no vote counted for that seat — but
// the printed Will of the Council pattern doesn't admit abstentions
// in practice; callers shouldn't return out-of-range values).
//
// If voteCallback is nil, each seat votes uniformly at random via
// gs.Rng (deterministic given the engine's seeded RNG). This is the
// "unscripted" default the task specifies — sufficient for stress
// tests, Loki fuzz runs, and engine-level smoke tests that don't care
// about strategic vote choice.

// WillOfCouncilVote is the per-seat decision callback. Returns 0 for
// optionA, 1 for optionB. Returns >= 2 to abstain (no vote tallied),
// though printed Will of the Council cards do not allow abstentions —
// callers should normally return 0 or 1.
type WillOfCouncilVote func(seat int, options [2]string) int

// TallyWillOfCouncil runs the voting round for a Will of the Council
// spell or ability controlled by `controllerSeat`. CR §701.18.
//
// Voting order: controllerSeat first, then living opponents in
// turn-order from the controller's left (the §101.4 convention used
// throughout the engine — same as Tempting Offer / Council's Judgment).
//
// Tie behavior: by default a tie returns winner == "". The tally map
// always carries both option counts, so the resolver can either:
//   - branch on winner != "" for a clear majority
//   - inspect the tally and apply card-specific tie rules (split effect,
//     "controller chooses", "neither effect happens", etc.)
//
// Returns:
//   - winner: optionA, optionB, or "" if the vote is tied
//   - tally:  map[optionA]countA, optionB]countB (always non-nil)
//
// Side effects: emits a "will_of_council_vote" event per voter (Seat
// = voter, Details["choice"] = chosen option), and a final
// "will_of_council_result" event with the winner and full tally.
