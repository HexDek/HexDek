## High Priority — Parser (100% Coverage Push)

*Empty — 100% coverage achieved (0 UnknownEffect across 31,963 cards)*


## High Priority — Engine

- [ ] **Remaining 276 commander handlers** — coverage at 447/652 files (750 registered names covering all 652 pool commanders). Template generator (`cmd/gen-handlers/main.go`) handles simple patterns. Pool now at 1292 decks (threshold lowered 100→80, 2026-05-05). #engine #per_card


## High Priority — Platform

- [ ] **Mobile full pass** — leaderboard, spectate, operator, meta pages need individual mobile audit at 375px. Deck drilldown done, rest pending. #ui #mobile
- [ ] **Mobile deck drilldown: curse data last** — on mobile, curse/genetic section should render below all other panels (currently positioned mid-page). #ui #mobile
- [ ] **Global glossary disclosure system** — every stat/label/metric across all pages tap-to-expand inline explanation. One shared component + glossary data source. Replaces FAQ concept. #ui #ux #accessibility
- [ ] **Curse Proficiency sigil** — cymatic SVG replacing curse section on deck page (circle → flower of life evolution, color-identity tinted). Part of "Hats" → "Curses" rebrand. #ui #design
- [ ] **Action button context boxes** — brief TLDR above gauntlet/test variant/etc buttons for neurodivergent UX clarity. #ui #ux #accessibility
- [ ] **"Consider Cutting" rationale** — each cut recommendation needs: what was detected (stats/pattern), why it's recommended (synergy gap, mana curve, etc), the resulting effect, and suggested swaps. #ui #deck #freya
- [ ] **Value Engine rationale** — explain WHY each value engine was identified for this deck (what cards/interactions trigger it, how the engine functions). #ui #deck #freya
- [ ] **Win Condition rationale** — show detection logic for each win-con (which cards form the line, what conditions are needed, how the combo resolves). #ui #deck #freya
- [ ] **Deck clone** — non-owners can clone a deck to their own collection for editing. Clone creates a copy under the cloner's owner dir, then they can rename/edit freely. #ui #platform
- [ ] **Reconnection countdown** — when WebSocket disconnects, show attempt number and countdown timer per reconnection attempt (currently just shows "DISCONNECTED — RECONNECTING"). #ui #ux
- [ ] **Magic link graceful flow** — user clicks email link → new tab catches the auth post and logs them in → tab auto-closes → original tab plays a console-style "logging in" feed animation → redirects to /operator. #ui #auth #ux


## High Priority — Learning Loop (Observability) — ALL PHASES DONE

*Ref: `docs/architecture-learning-loop.md` + `docs/architecture-hat-evolution.md`*
*Phase 1 (Heimdall), Phase 2 (Muninn+Huginn), Phase 3 (Huginn→Freya) all complete 2026-05-02. Loop validated live on DARKSTAR.*


## High Priority — Hat Intelligence — ALL LEVELS DONE

*Ref: `docs/architecture-hat-evolution.md` Levels 2-3*
*Level 2 (Combo Sequencer), Level 2.5 (State Machine), Level 3 (Genetic Curse) all complete 2026-05-02.*

*Ref: `docs/architecture-hat-evolution.md` Levels 4-5.*
*Level 4 (Staged Decision Architecture), Level 5 (IS-MCTS) complete 2026-05-02/04.*


## Medium Priority — Engine

- [ ] **Temporal Pincer** — anon UUID cookie → session tracking → on login stitch all anon device UUIDs to authenticated profile. No PII, all UUIDs. Powers P&R via GraphQL. #infra #platform
- [ ] **BUG: Esika/Prismatic Bridge 9.2% WR** — systemic B5 combo execution issue. Bridge should flip and cast free spells every upkeep but combo assembly/sequencing not firing correctly. #engine #bug #per_card
- [ ] **BUG: Multiple B5 decks at 13-14% WR** — combo execution ceiling across several B5 commanders. Likely related to Esika issue — combo sequencer not recognizing all win-line piece states. #engine #bug #combo
- [ ] **34K corpus audit** — auto-verify every Scryfall card against its AST: outcome + CR pathway compliance. 4 era batches. Validates parser coverage claims at scale. #engine #qa


## Medium Priority — Platform

- [ ] BOINC-style distributed compute (desktop client → contribute games → earn credits) #distributed
- [ ] **Deterministic seed capture (anti-cheat Phase 1)** — surface the existing Heimdall seed ring buffer + JSONL flush as a cryptographic per-game seed contract; sign at game-start, verify on replay; required before spot-check + cauterize phases. Builds on the seed capture work already wired into all 3 game paths #anticheat
- [ ] Deterministic replay anti-cheat (cryptographic seed, spot-check 2-5%, auto-cauterize bad actors) — *enhanced by seed capture from Phase 1* #anticheat
- [ ] Statistical anomaly detection (per-contributor distribution tracking, 3σ flagging) #anticheat
- [ ] Credit economy (contribute compute → earn credits → spend on own deck testing) #economy
- [ ] Stream/narrator layer (game state → visual renderer → Twitch/OBS output) #stream
- [ ] **Stream/narrator OBS overlay** — concrete OBS browser-source build of the narrator layer: transparent-background spectator viewport, Ive three-act narrative caption strip, lower-third commander tags, configurable seat order. Targets streamer use over the open spectator feed. #stream #ui


## Low Priority — Hat Research (Bronze tier) — MOSTLY DONE

*Ref: `docs/architecture-hat-evolution.md` Levels 6-7 + Skunkworks.*
*Level 6 (Neural Position Evaluator), Level 7 (Self-Play Loop), Skunkworks (Tesla/Feynman/Lovelace/Ive/Watts) all complete 2026-05-02.*



## Low Priority

- [ ] **i18n — IN PROGRESS** — scaffolding shipped (i18n.js + locales/ + useT() hook + URL/navigator detection across 8 locales, commit 059a9d1, 2026-05-04). Content translation remaining: ~500 UI keys × 8+ languages still need professional translation; Scryfall localized card names integration also pending. #platform
- [ ] Multi-format support beyond Commander (Modern, Legacy deck ratings) #engine

(2026-05-05) #engine #bug #mdfc
- [x] **Genetic→Neural distillation** — Curse→neural feedback loop: HarvestHighFitness (top-quartile DNA), EnrichWithDNA (fitness-weighted training samples), SeedDNAFromManifest (warm-start new pools from archetype centroids), TryCycle (non-blocking 30min cooldown, reseed underperformers). 17 tests. (2026-05-05) #research #selfplay
- [x] **N-card combo line detection** — Huginn N-tuple pipeline fully wired: `DetectCoTriggerNTuples()` → `PersistRawNTuples()` → `IngestNTuples()` → `tier3_ntuples_for_freya.json`. CLI ingest/prune/stats/list commands added. Freya reads both pairwise and N-tuple exports. (2026-05-05) #engine #huginn #combo
- [x] **Muninn persist batching** — tournament runner wired to `Batcher` in all 3 paths (Run, runPool, runLazyPool). `feedBatcher()` streams parser gaps, crashes, concessions, dead triggers per-game. Auto-flush every 30s/100 games. `persistPostTournament()` for non-Muninn data. (2026-05-05) #engine #performance
- [x] **Feynman outlier fixes** — zone accounting: asymmetric tolerance `diff < -3 || diff > 20` (copy/clone positive diffs normal, missing cards = real bugs). game_end: turn-capped games (≥80 turns) downgraded to "info". 4 new tests. (2026-05-05) #engine #hat #feynman
- [x] **Gauntlet pool fix** — threshold 100→80, diagnostic logging for filtered decks (parse/noCmd/small/banned breakdown). Pool 1200→1292 decks. All 7174n1c decks now in engine. (2026-05-05) #engine #bug
- [x] **Tesla ExtractPivot panic fix** — guard against `winnerSeat=-1` (turn-cap draw games with no winner). Was crashing server during gauntlet runs. (2026-05-05) #engine #bug
- [x] **Tabs on deck drilldown** — Analysis / Deck List / Achievements tab layout on deck pages (2026-05-05) #ui #deck
